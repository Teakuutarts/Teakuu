<center><h1>General & Standardized TOS</h1></center>
- You may read our TOS here & privacy-policy <b><a href="https://www.teakuu.com/tos"><span class="label">here</span></a></b>
<br/><br/><br/>
<h1>Why Teakuu?</h1>
- We genuinely love the idea of diversity as much as people hide away the fact that it "doesn't work", our team finds ways to make interesting things happen in any field we so please to pursue.<br/>
- Changing the meta is the whole idea behind Teakuu. To do things differently from the norm while not straying too far from the good things.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<center><h1>Partnership Terms</h1></center>
- We are still working on this, but for now, you may review the next section and decide for yourself.<br/><br/>
<center><h1>Expressed Disclosure</h1></center>
<center><p>
- In all of our assets, we make it clear that we are under the bare minimum license & higher:<br/>
Creative Commons - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/<br/>
Anything that we do not own or license typically will fall under the GNU license.<br/>
- Expressed interest in any third party works in ownership of both groups must be complied with if accepted. This includes but is not limited to planning, refined works, involvement, etc.
- Financial support must be met to the extent of basic functionality of operations unless talked about otherwise, which to that point will not fall under any sort of responsibility on our behalf. Whether the ability to comply with this due to the lack of stability or reasons other than disagreement can be discussed after partnership is established.<br/>
- Partnership may not be canceled during high operating times, or times of importance. It must be scheduled. This avoids any means to damage the works of the other party by any means.<br/>
- Failure to comply with higher expressed terms disclosed here will be dealt at the discretion of our team if said partnership has already been established.<br/>
</p></center>
<br/>
<h1>Your Benefits</h1>
